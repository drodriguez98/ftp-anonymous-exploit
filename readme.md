## Login

First check if the FTP server allows anonymous access. If the FTP server is not vulnerable, other functionalities will not be successful.

## Listing files

If the server is vulnerable, try listing the directories. You will get a list of all the directories shared by FTP and information about their permissions.

## Uploading file

You will be able to upload a file to the directories depending on the permissions established for each one. The file to be uploaded must be in the same directory as the script. To select the directory where you want to upload the file, type the full path.

## Downloading all

The same will happen with downloads. You will get the directories with all their content or locations depending on the permissions of each of them.
